"""Apply a distill JSON (cards for books 46-54) into the chainsaw brain.

Reads cards.json (array per the distill schema), then:
  - writes brain/cards/NN_isbn.md in card format
  - saves syntheses/synthesis_NN_isbn.md, points _books.json file field at it
  - confirms/corrects lobe in _books.json
  - regenerates brain/INDEX.md: route-by-signal counts/lists + full chain map
    with reciprocal synapses (new edges added in BOTH directions)
Additive to existing 01-45 edges; nothing is dropped.
